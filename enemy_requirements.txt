enemy member functions / variables:

self.hp
		self explanatory

self.dmg
		this shows how much damage was just dealt this turn
		The controller can read this variable to find out how much damage an attack did.

self.msg
		a string that describes the attack
		usage examples:

			"XXX used fireball"
			"XXX is charging an attack"
			"XXX holds its turn"
			(XXX = the enemy's name)

-------------------
take_turn()
	start the unit's turn.  The controller will call this function when a unit's turn starts
	inside this function, you can outline what the unit does
			maybe it deals damage based on how much hp its missing
			maybe it does a big attack that damages itself
			maybe it heals itself when its low on health

	this behaviour could be randomly generated, or maybe determined by how much hp a unit has

	maybe some special attack happens when they take more that 5 damage in one turn

	maybe it's moves cycle between a few options, based on what it did last turn.

	This function will set self.dmg and self.msg to describe what it did this turn

---------------------
example, a unit called "Blub" could heal itself:	
		self.hp += 5 				#heal self by adding health
		self.dmg = 0 				#set damage to zero, since this wouldn't deal any damage

				#set message to something descriptive
		self.msg = "Blub healed itself!" 

---------------------
another example
		self.hp -= 2
	    self.dmg = 10
	    
	    self.msg = "Blub made a reckless attack!"

unit damages itself to do a powerful attack

---------------------
additional ideas:
	unit could charge for multiple turns in order to make a big attack
---------------------

these concepts are the framework for a unit, 
with their AI being a series of if statements inside
the take_turn() function

the controller class will go through all of the enemies on the board,
and can read out the results of their turns one by one.

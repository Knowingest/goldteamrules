Ilia: *groggily waking up* What happened?
Ilia: Huh--? A cave-in?
Ilia: This isn't good...
Ilia: Guess I need to find a way out.
Ilia: What is this place even? All these swirls...

Blub: *squish*

Ilia: What... is that?

Blub: *squiiiish*

Ilia: Gross. *pokes it with her sword*

Blub: *SQUASH*

Ilia: Oh no. Good thing I brought this sword.

Battle start!

Ilia: *huff* *huff* Alright. *huff* That wasn't too bad. *huff*
Ilia: Let's go.

--------------
Area 2:
Ilia: Hey, water. Now I'll only starve to death.
Ilia: ...? There's something in here.
Ilia: ....
Ilia: "Beware of mother...?" What does that mean?

//Next fight

--------------
Area 3:
Ilia: A crossroads... That's neat. Which way, then?
Spooder: *hiss*
Ilia: Oh, this again. Guess I'll decide afterwards.

//Next fight

Ilia: What's with this place? So many monsters.
Ilia: Guess that's what I get for exploring a cave armed with a sword.

--------------
Area 5:
(Prior to Area 4 visit)

Ilia: What is this wall? Looks creepy... It's super different from the other swirls.
Ilia: This thing kind of looks like a lock. Do I need a key?
Ilia: Ah, here we go again.
//Fight!

--------------
Area 4:
(After area 5 visit)

Ilia: Oh great. I guess this guy is some sort of miniboss.

Big Blub: *SQUISH*

Ilia: You have the key, I bet. Here we go.

//Battle


GOT RED KEY
Ilia: Yup. There it is.

--------------
Area 4:
(prior to area 5 visit)

Big Blub: *SQUISH*

Ilia: Whoa there. You're a bit bigger than the other guys...

Big Blub: *SQUOSH*

Ilia: You wanna go, then? Alright!

//Fight

Ilia: Huh? A key? Guess I'll find out what this is for.

--------------
Area 5:
(after getting key)

Ilia: Red key, red wall with a keyhole... this should work.
Ilia: Locked wall thing, meet weird key thing.
//Change BG
Ilia: It worked! Hopefully this will lead somewhere useful...

---------------
Area 6:
Ilia: Whoa... This is beautiful.

Mother: Hello, my child. Are you alright?

Ilia: Who are you?

Mother: My name is Mother. I've been watching your struggle. Are you hurt at all?

Ilia: I'm a little scuffed up, yeah, but I'm fine.

Mother: Come here. Let me heal you.

Approach Mother? [Y/N]
